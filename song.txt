Immortal temptation takes over my mind
Condemned
Falling weak on my knees, summon the strength
Of mayhem
Through vacant halls I won’t surrendеr
The truth revealеd in eyes of ember
We fight through fire and ice forever
Two souls once lost, and now they remember

Inherit the nightmare, surrounded by fate
Can’t run away
Keep walking the line, between the light
Led astray
